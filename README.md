### This project analyzes attractions and sights in European cities and assesses whether a city pass is worth buying depending on the interests of the traveler. 

### The plan for this project is as follows:

- Get list of European cities (start with just ones with passes)
- For each city, get list of sights there
- For each city, get list of sights included in pass
- Determine cost of pass
- Determine cost of each sight 
- Determine additional details that might help the traveler, such as inclusion of public transit
- Generate itineraries based on interests, hotel location, length of stay, traveler type (family, solo, disabled, etc.) of traveler
- Recommend pass or not

### Data acquisition
